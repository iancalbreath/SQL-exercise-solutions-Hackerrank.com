My solution:

SELECT
    [Doctor] as Doctor, 
    [Professor] as Professor, 
    [Singer] as Singer,
    [Actor] as Actor
FROM

(SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Occupation order by name asc) as rn, name, occupation FROM OCCUPATIONS) AS SourceT;

PIVOT (
max(Name) FOR [Occupation] IN ([Actor], [Doctor], [Professor], [Singer])
) as PivotT;
